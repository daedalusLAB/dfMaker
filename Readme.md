## Installation Guide

This guide provides a step-by-step process to set up your environment for using `dfMaker`, including the installation of R, RStudio (optional), and how to run `dfMaker`.

### Step 1: Installing R

`dfMaker` requires R to be installed on your system. Follow these instructions to install R:

1. **Visit CRAN**: Navigate to the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/) to access the R distribution for your operating system.

2. **Download R**:
    - **Windows**: Click on "Download R for Windows", then "install R for the first time" to download the R installer.
    - **MacOS**: Click on "Download R for (Mac) OS X", and download the latest `.pkg` file.
    - **Linux**: Click on "Download R for Linux", choose your distribution, and follow the instructions to use your package manager for installation.

3. **Install R**: Run the downloaded installer or package file and follow the prompts to complete the installation of R on your system.

### Step 2: Installing RStudio (Optional)

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It's optional but recommended for a more user-friendly experience.

1. **Visit RStudio**: Go to the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) to find the RStudio Desktop version for your operating system.

2. **Download RStudio**:
    - Select the free version named "RStudio Desktop Open Source License" and download it for your operating system.

3. **Install RStudio**: Execute the downloaded file and follow the installation instructions to install RStudio on your computer.

### Step 3: Running `dfMaker`

With R (and optionally RStudio) installed, you're ready to use `dfMaker`.

1. **Install `arrow` package** (if not already installed by `dfMaker`):

    ```r
    if (!require("arrow", quietly = TRUE)) {
      install.packages("arrow", dependencies = TRUE, ask = FALSE)
      library(arrow)
    }
    ```
    Note: `dfMaker` is designed to check for the `arrow` package and install it automatically if it's not present.

2. **Load `dfMaker`**:
    - Ensure `dfMaker.rda` is in your working directory or provide the full path to the file.
    ```r
    load("dfMaker.rda")  # Adjust the path as necessary
    ```

3. **Execute `dfMaker`**:
    - Use `dfMaker` by specifying the directory with your OpenPose JSON files. By default, `dfMaker` processes these files and saves the output in `./df_outputs/` with an auto-generated file name.
    ```r
    dfMaker(input.folder = "path/to/your/JSON/files")
    ```

This setup ensures you have everything needed to start working with `dfMaker` effectively, from installing the necessary software to running the function itself.



## Usage

Load the `dfMaker` function into your R session:

```r
load("dfMaker.rda")
```

Below are several examples demonstrating different use cases:

### Basic Usage

Automatically process OpenPose JSON files and save the output with an auto-generated name based on unique IDs:

```r
dfMaker(input.folder = "./path/to/input")
```

### Saving to a Specific File

Process data and explicitly save it as a Parquet file:

```r
dfMaker(input.folder = "./path/to/input",
        output.file = "./path/to/outputs/processed_data.parquet")
```

For CSV output:

```r
dfMaker(input.folder = "./path/to/input",
        output.file = "./path/to/outputs/processed_data.csv")
```

### In-memory Processing Without Saving

Process files for in-memory use without saving to disk:

```r
example <- dfMaker(input.folder = "./path/to/input",
                   no_save = TRUE)
```

### Specifying Output Path

Define an output path for saving the processed file with an automatically generated name:

```r
dfMaker(input.folder = "./path/to/input",
        output.path = "./path/to/custom_output/")
```


### Parameters

- `input.folder`: The directory containing JSON files output by OpenPose. Each file should represent keypoints data for a single frame of video.
- `config.path`: Optional. The path to a JSON configuration file specifying which metadata fields to extract and include in the output. If not provided, default settings are used.
- `output.file`: Optional. Specifies the path and filename for the output file. If provided, the function writes the processed data to this file in either CSV or Parquet format, determined by the file extension. If not provided or empty, and multiple unique IDs are not found, the function automatically names the file based on the unique ID from the OpenPose data.
- `output.path`: Optional. Specifies the directory where the output file will be saved. If `output.file` is not provided or is empty, and there's exactly one unique ID in the processed data, the function automatically creates an output file named after the unique ID within this directory. If `output.path` is not specified, the function will create a default directory `./df_outputs/` to save the output file. This ensures organized storage of output files, especially useful when processing multiple datasets or running batch processes.

### Configuration File Structure

The configuration file is a JSON document that allows users to specify additional metadata to extract from the file names or directory structure. The structure of the configuration file is as follows:

```json
{
  "extract_datetime": false,
  "extract_time": false,
  "extract_exp_search": false,
  "extract_country_code": false,
  "extract_network_code": false,
  "extract_program_name": false,
  "extract_time_range": false,
  "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles"
}
```

Each field in the configuration file is a boolean that indicates whether the corresponding piece of metadata should be extracted. The `timezone` field specifies the timezone for datetime conversion.

## Functionality

`dfMaker` performs the following operations:
- Reads JSON files from `input.folder`, each representing keypoints data for individual frames produced by OpenPose.
- Processes each file according to the configurations specified in `config.path` (if provided).
- Constructs \( M_{i,j} \) matrices for each detected person and point type, organizing keypoints data into a structured format.
- Optionally extracts additional metadata based on file names and the specified configuration.
- Combines all processed data into a single dataframe.
- Outputs the consolidated data to `output.file` in the specified format (CSV or Parquet), automatically naming the file based on unique IDs if required.

## Output

The function returns a dataframe in R, containing the combined keypoints data from all processed frames, along with any extracted metadata. If `output.file` is specified, it also writes this data to a file in the chosen format.

This tool facilitates the detailed analysis of human poses, movements, and interactions, supporting research and development in areas such as motion analysis, computer vision, and interactive systems.




## Algebraic Definition of Matrix

The \( M_{i,j} \) matrix is an organized representation of the keypoints data processed by OpenPose. This structured matrix format simplifies the handling and analysis of keypoints data by organizing it into rows and columns, where each row corresponds to a keypoint and each column represents one of the three attributes: x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and the confidence score. Here's the structured representation of the matrix:

$$
M_{i,j} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
K_{1,x} & K_{1,y} & K_{1,c} \\
K_{2,x} & K_{2,y} & K_{2,c} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
K_{N,x} & K_{N,y} & K_{N,c}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

In this matrix:

- \( K \) represents any keypoint.

- \( N \) represents the \( N \)-th keypoint.

- \( j \) (the column index) indicates which variable (x, y, c) is being described.

This format ensures that each keypointâ€™s positional and confidence data is systematically organized and easily accessible for further processing and analysis.



## Coordinate Transformation and Y-Axis Inversion

This section explains the process of normalizing keypoints coordinates obtained from computer vision software, ensuring the data aligns with a mathematical coordinate system. Given the nature of computer vision data, where the origin often differs from traditional Cartesian systems, we introduce a method to normalize and adjust the orientation of keypoints data.


### Axial Reflection

As we observed in the below figure, the original coordinates from `OpenPose` are positioned in a Cartesian quadrant, specifically the first quadrant where all values are positive. Additionally, since the origin of coordinates is fixed at the top-left corner, the values increase as we move down the image. This poses a challenge in interpreting the data, which can make it difficult, if not impossible, to conceive complex models for Human Pose Estimation (HPE).

![Example of HPE vector space transformation](./images/coordDiff.png)

For this reason, it is necessary to obtain a coherent coordinate system that allows us to interpret the human pose in a more intuitive way. A simple reflection, which is even simpler in two dimensions, allows us to present our HPE data effectively for modeling with minimal computational cost.

To perform a reflection, we only need to multiply the *key points* ($P_k(x_i,y_j)$) by the identity matrix, where the sign for the 'y' axis vector is changed. Instead of the second column of the identity matrix defining the unit of the 'y' axis as (0,1), it is (0,-1). This sign change automatically inverts the axis without the need for further mathematical operations.

$$
I_{x,y} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & -1 
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Given a point $P(a,b)$, to reflect it over the 'x' axis, we multiply $P$ by $I_{x,y}$:

$$
P' = P \cdot I_{x,y} = \begin{bmatrix} a & b \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a & -b \end{bmatrix}
$$



### Applying Cramer's Rule for Coordinate Transformation

Cramer's Rule offers a systematic way to solve systems of linear equations that arise during the normalization and transformation of keypoints coordinates from computer vision outputs. This method is particularly useful for calculating the transformation matrix coefficients when we need to adjust the coordinate system based on keypoints, such as normalizing distances or inverting axes. It is a theorem in linear algebra that provides the solution to a system of linear equations with as many equations as unknowns, given that the system's matrix determinant is non-zero. This makes it especially handy for calculating transformations involving scaling and rotation where the equations are linear.


To apply Cramer's Rule for our purpose of coordinate normalization and Y-axis inversion, consider a system where the transformations are linear and can be represented by equations relating original keypoints to their transformed counterparts. For a transformation involving normalization based on the distance between specific keypoints (like the chest and shoulder) and inversion of the Y-axis, the system of equations can be represented as follows:

![](./images/dfMaker_expression2.png)

To begin, we need to define our transformation matrix for the new coordinate system. In the generic case of `dfMaker`, the left shoulder point, identified as point 5 in the `pose_keypoints` ($P_{5}^{pose}$), is chosen to define the unit. Additionally, we need to consider the reflection of the 'y' axis over the 'x' axis.

Once the transformation matrix is defined, we only need to multiply each point in the frame ($P_k(x_i,y_j)$) by this matrix. This multiplication allows us to obtain the equivalent point in our new coordinate system.



## Integration with Computer Vision Data

When working with keypoints data from computer vision software like OpenPose, this approach allows for precise adjustment of the coordinate system to fit analytical or visualization needs. By applying transformations derived through Cramer's Rule, data scientists and researchers can ensure that their keypoints data is properly scaled and oriented, facilitating more accurate analysis and interpretation of human poses and movements.
